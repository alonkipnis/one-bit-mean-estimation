# one-bit-mean-estimation

This project studies the problem of estimating the mean of a distribution under the constraint that only a single bit per sample from this distribution is available to the estimator. We study the mean squared error risk in this estimation as a function of the number of samples, and hence number of bits, from this distribution.
