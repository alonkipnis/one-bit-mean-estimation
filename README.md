# one-bit-mean-estimation

This project studies the problem of estimating the mean of a distribution under the constraint that only a single bit per sample from this distribution is available to the estimator. We study the mean squared error risk in this estimation as a function of the number of samples, and hence number of bits, from this distribution. 

The content of each directory is as follows:
1) Code -- python and matlab code for generating figures
2) Figs -- all graphic files used in genrating the writeups and the slides
3) Slides -- LaTex code of the slides
4) Writeups -- LaTex code of the writeups
